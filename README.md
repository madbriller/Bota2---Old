Bota2
=====

A small project of mine to allow tracking of professional Dota2 games and to provide statistics.

This versions allows the input of match data atleast.

Lots to do! This version contains:
-Updated match tracking, uses ID's rather than names now; makes things easier to track internally. 
-Overall Vs winrate between two teams is implemented roughly


TODO:
-Add total VS games indicator in middle section
-Add total games indicator above teams
-Add colour indications to labels
-Add all algorithms for full statistic tracking
-Error checking!
-Many other things..
