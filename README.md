A small project of mine to allow tracking of professional Dota2 games and to provide statistics.

This versions allows the input of match data atleast.

Lots to do! This version contains:
- All stats are now calculated and roughly displayed.
- Made Interface easier to work with.
- Began adding team and match data (included in data.db3)


TODO:
- Clean it up
- Add team/match management
- Add regions
- Add sample size indicator
- Add colour indications to labels
- Error checking!
- Sanity Checking
- Many other things..
