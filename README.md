=====

A small project of mine to allow tracking of professional Dota2 games and to provide statistics.

This versions allows the input of match data atleast.

Lots to do! This version contains:

-Updated match tracking, uses ID's rather than names now; makes things easier to track internally. 

-Overall Vs winrate between two teams is implemented roughly


TODO:

-Add total VS games indicator in middle section

-Add total games indicator above teams

-Add colour indications to labels

-Add all algorithms for full statistic tracking

-Error checking!

-Many other things..
